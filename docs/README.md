## Customer-facing documents
These are the documents that we are maintaining for the customer-facing Wiki. You can find a helpful markdown cheatsheet here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet (SM - 12/25/18)

1. **Release Notes** - Converging on Release v1.1. Need to bundle together *GoES-BMC*, *GoES-boot*, the kernel module *platina-mk1*, *GoES* within the Platina build process. We need to validate that we can complete a build from scratch. (*Status: Gopal will finalize new version.*)
2. **Platina Appliance Head User Guide** - This is a comprehensive user-facing document that describes the operation and usage of the Platina Appliance Head. It consolidates elements of the deprecated documents below. (*Status: Under development.*)
