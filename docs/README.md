2. Platina Software Update Process - Instructions to upgrade various software components including Kernel. (*Status: Under  review, need Kevin's input. Matt following up.*)
3. Release Notes - Converging on Release v1.1. Need to bundle together *GoES-BMC*, *GoES-boot*, the kernel module *platina-mk1*, *GoES* within the Platina build process. We need to validate that we can complete a build from scratch. (*Status: Gopal created new version.*)
4. Platina Command Line Guide - Detailed description for all available commands. (*Status: Matt taking a pass at cleaning up formatting from Calsoft version to simplify markdown. Subsequetly, we divide into four portions and edit for final clean-up. See markdown cheatsheet here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet *)
5. Method of Procedure - Provides detailed steps to unbox & install HW and describes configuration steps to setup access to the box. (*Status: First version is for Limelight. Rahul has mostly finished checking it out and we are almost done.*)
